# About Me


I am a practicing Data Scientist and Chemical Engineer. For over three years I have worked as a Quality and Control engineer at Dams Flourish Paint Nigeria limited, where I have also recently gotten the opportunity to use my data science skills to analyze the business data and unravel hidden patterns that has helped management make great decisions with tools like Python, PostgreSQL, and Excel.

I continue to self improve and this has made me advance my skillset in the aforementioned programming languages, with focus on statistical analysis and Machine Learning application.

I am currently leading a team on a Machine Learning project to predict future food prices in Nigeria with the aim of tackling food insecurity and help plan expenditure.

I would love to combine my engineering and data science skills to continue providing well-developed data-driven recommendations to businesses around the globe.
